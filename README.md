# Organ-Donation-Management-System
An organ donation management system made using Java's AWT package for the deployment of organ records in different cities.
The need for organs for donation is far greater than organ availability. In the last decade this has led to restructuring and investment in the organ donation programme with political and public support. 
For this reason we came up with an organ donation management system which will allow patients to check the availability of organs in an around their area.

Initial Modules:
>SignUp

>Login

>Home

>Availability of organs in particular city

>Donate/Ask for organs
